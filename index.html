      <p><b>Open Source Life is a collection of short writings to proclaim the joy of life and help all beings recognize that.</b> Currently, technology plays a critical role and influences our community. We believe that open source programming is a perfect platform to express this message of hope. We also see programming as a beautiful means of self-expression and creativity. Open Source Life is an attempt to combine these dreams, inspiring all to live a happy and integrated life.</p>
