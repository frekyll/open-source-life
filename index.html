      <p><b>Open Source Life is a little collection of writings on the joy of embodiment and technology as a means to express that.</b> Here, you may find anything from a how-to article on writing code, to ways in which we can recognize our nature as happiness. With tech playing an integral part in our sense of community, we'd like to bring more playfulness to it—inspiring a generation to view coding as a beautiful means of self-expression. We hope you find something useful here ✌️</p>
